# Android-Music-Player


Note: Music player developed by Michael Jimenez, Marcos Serrano, and I. 
Note: While building this, we were learning how to use Android Studios at the same time 
Note: Orginally based on the guide created by Sue Smith
Note: I added the Android Spotification Tools, and it does make an API call to Spotify's service, 
but, as of the current version, Android's Spotify SDK Tools do not include user playback for their own albums.
So, I plan on integrating it with my team using a Java Wrapper for Spotify's Web API Tools. I integrated it in 
a few weeks back and, hopefully, the team and I can learn more about it and integrate it soon in order to combine
music libraries.
